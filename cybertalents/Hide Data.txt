When I opened the challenge I got this cypher text

I went to this website https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher to decode the cypher text , after decoding I got this text :
the flag is 2j68yfhqlz It is pretty easy to see the flag but can you see it i took nearly 1 minute to encode this with ROT13 good luck in solving that
The flag is :
2j68yfhqlz
