When I opened the challenge url I found a login page that asks for a username and a password , I tried to view the page source and I found this comment :
<!-- 
     Guest Account:
     -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
     Username:Guest
     Password:Guest  
-->

After I logged in with this credentials I got a page displays this message :	

Access Denied.Â You have no admin priviliges, Please login with an administrator account
I opened the storage in the dev tools and navigated to cookies and I found this cookie :Authentication=bG9naW49R3Vlc3Q%3D
The  value of the authentication cookie is base64 encoded and the = is url encoded "%3d"
So I opened the burp decoder and decoded the value of the authentication cookie "bG9naW49R3Vlc3Q="
I got this after decoding : login=Guest
So I changed the login value to login=admin , and encoded this as base64 and replaced the = with %3d
The final authentication cookie value is : bG9naW49YWRtaW4%3d
I replaced the original value with our value and refreshed the page 
We got the flag
